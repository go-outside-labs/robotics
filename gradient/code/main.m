% This code perform gradient-domain fusion between an image and a
% background with two techniques:
%   1) Poisson Blending,
%   2) Mixed Gradients.
%
%   This is homework for Tamara Berg's class. The code also includes 
%   an option for a toy model that just reconstruct the image from 
%   its gradient.
